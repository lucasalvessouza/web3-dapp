The first idea is testing a Ethereum transaction between two accounts, using a Smart Contract to make the transactions.

Stack: React, Typescript, Solidity, Hardhat, Alchemy, Ether.js, MetaMask.

## How to Use
You must install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and create a wallet. We're using a Sepolia Test Network.
