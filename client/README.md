# ReactCoin

This is a project focused on Web3 and it's part of studies of DApps.

We are simulating a marketplace where the user can buy any products directly with the seller, using Ether as payment method.

Stack: React, Typescript, Solidity, Hardhat, Alchemy, Ether.js, MetaMask.

## How to Use


You must install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and create a wallet. We're using a Sepolia Test Network.
