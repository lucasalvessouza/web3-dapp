This is a project focused on Web3 and it's part of studies of DApps.
</br>
We are simulating a marketplace where the user can buy any products directly with the seller, using Ether as payment method.
The purchase is simulated by a transaction between two accounts.

<b>It's live! You can access [here](https://web3-dapp-psi.vercel.app/)</b>

## Good to know
- We are using testnet.
- The seller account is a common account I created to all products. In a real world, would be many products from a different sellers.

Stack: React, Typescript, Solidity, Hardhat, Alchemy, Ether.js, MetaMask.

## How to Use


You must install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and create a wallet. We're using a Sepolia Test Network.

You can use this [Faucet](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia) to get a test ether.
